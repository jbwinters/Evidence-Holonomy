# Background Pack: Evidence Holonomy & Universal Evidence Curvature (UEC)

This folder collects background notes, motivation, and related work that support the paper’s main thesis:
**irreversibility is the curvature of inference under loops of representation.**

**Contents**
1. `01_uec_overview.md` — High-level motivation, minimal formalism, a 2‑state Markov example, and an implementable estimation recipe (“Holonomy Meter”).
2. `02_related_work.md` — Focused literature review connecting entropy production, time‑reversal asymmetry, and KL rates; model‑free estimation trends.
3. `03_applications_and_agents.md` — Applications across domains (physics, physiology, AI, markets) and how Arrow‑of‑Time (AoT) signals inform agent design.

> These notes are observer‑agnostic and domain‑general. No domain‑specific finance or asset references are required to understand or apply the ideas.
